The `src` folder contains the skeleton of an AngularJS-based webapp.
 
It includes a base $route system, an empty service, an empty directive, and an empty template.
Also included is the base bootstrap.css file for grid systems, and a `data.json` file that is to be
loaded and parsed by the AngularJS code.
